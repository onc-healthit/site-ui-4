        Upon successful receipt of the message, the Direct Transport Test Tool will send an MDN(Message Disposition
        Notification) back to the senderâ€™s email address. The content of the message can be anything and is not
        validated or used by the SITE. To validate if a message was received from your test system, enter your Direct
        From address which you used to send the message below and search for messages. The test tool will display the
        last message received from the Direct From address entered if any exist.
