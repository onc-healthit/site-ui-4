      "question": "What is SITE?",
      "answer": "The Standards Implementation & Testing Environment (SITE) is a centralized collection of testing tools and resources designed to assist health IT developers and users in fully evaluating specific technical standards and maximizing the potential of their health IT implementations. SITE includes test tools, sample data, collaboration resources, and useful links."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get started with SITE?",
      "answer": "Step-by-step guidance on creating an account, setting up your profile, and navigating through SITE's user-friendly interface."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key features of SITE?",
      "answer": "SITE includes ONC Certification Tools, General Testing Tools, and Resources.  ONC Certification Tools include FHIR resources, C-CDA testing, clinical quality measure testing, electronic prescribing tools, public health reporting testing, and alternative testing. Our General Testing Tools include a suite of general testing tools, including the CPOE Evaluation Tool, IHE Testing Tools, Lantern Project, and the Inferno HL7 FHIR Validator.  In addition to this FAQ resource, videos and documentation help enhance your understanding of SITE."

Can you confirm the SHA-256 option is sending the correct hash? It appears to be sending the SHA-1 hash in the message.",
      "answer": "The first is the hash used to sign the Direct message. The second is the hash that is used in the XD* metadata and refers only to the hash of the attachment itself. These are two separate hashes, calculated independently. \n The first hash is defined in the Direct Applicability Statement. Version 1.0 mentions both SHA-1 and SHA-256 which is why the Direct portion of the ETT tooling allows both to be used for testing. \n The second hash (which is the one from the SOAP body below) is part of the XD* metadata. The definition of the hash slot is in IHE ITI TF Vol 3 Table 4.2.3.2-1 (page 64) http://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_TF_Vol3.pdf. The data type for this hash is \"SHA1\" only. The document metadata is separate from the signing of the Direct message."

If you have registered, please check the spam folder to see if the validation report has been held there.  Also, the local mailbox (the part before the '@' symbol) portion is case-sensitive;verify that the case in what was registered matches what is being sent."

Clicking the widget on the right side, for the corresponding address, will copy it to your clipboard. \n- If you are using CCDA R2.1, the direct address will be generated when you select the document you are conforming to.

    {
      "question": "In the Direct section of the ETT, sending a direct message to the system under test results in a validation result for the MDNs the SUT produces. I don't believe this case should be sending validation results at all since the testing is around the certificates rather than the MDNs. It looks like the MDNs are being validated as direct messages whether or not the MDN is wrapped. The ETT also seems to be fine with the MDNs in test cases 39, 40 and 41. Should we be receiving validation results for our MDNs in this case?",
      "answer": "The Direct section of the tool always returns validation reports because it has no programmatic way of knowing what the endpoint is being used for. If the test you are running doesn't need a validation report, the validation report can be ignored. The tool accepts wrapped or unwrapped because of backward compatibility with the previous round of certification where wrapped was optional. Information on whether the message was wrapped or unwrapped is contained in the validation report. Edge test cases won't produce separate validation reports."

My DIRECT Server is not rejecting this message, though I have an invalid trust anchor in my DIRECT Server.",
      "answer": "The certificate that you are selecting is the “Signing Certificate”. So a GOOD CERT will send a message with a signing certificate that is valid. The trust anchor, that you have, should dictate whether messages from a particular address is accepted or rejected. If you don’t have the right trust anchor, then the message should be rejected. That is the expected behavior."

Try the test cases again with the required header.\n EDGE SMTP MT Test 18(a) and EDGE SMTP MT Test 47(a) is a SMTP-SMTP scenario.

      "answer": "This difference in the workflows is an artifact of the underlying technologies and unfortunately not something that would be easy to change on our UI. For XDR, the endpoints must be established ahead of time or else the systems wouldn't know where to send messages. The Direct From address must be known so that the message can be properly routed within the ETT to the correct test instance while the test case is running. The ETT and Toolkit are an active part of this communication. The ETT must be primed BEFORE the communication takes place.\nFor SMTP, the ETT only becomes involved after the mail has been sent and is sitting in a mailbox. The SMTP communication/commands must be completed before ETT can check, or else there is nothing for ETT to find.

If it is asynchronously, a delivery failure message will be delivered.\nProctor Action: The individuals operating the SUT will inform the Proctor how their system responds when a message is asked to be delivered to an address that is non-existent. In the UI, the same logs screen will be used in either the sync or the async case. Depending on whether the communication is sync or async, the Proctor will expect to see a registry response failure in the response tab of the logs (for sync) or a message delivery failure on the request tab of the logs (for async).\nSteps:\n1) Populate the fields.

If there are issues with the CN name, it is possible to map the host file (1).\nb. Alternatively make a change programmatically per the IHE recommendation (2).\nIt is acceptable to use the hostname implementation approach or the approach identified by the IHE. Using the approach identified in the IHE wiki will allow you to interoperate with other Endpoints who follow the IHE spec and provide certificates which don’t have the right CN value.\nIf you did it programmatically, you set the address as the requirement; however, the host name approach is also fine as long as you know that in the real world might encounter the same issue and you will have add more host names.\n(1) Please see the post below for the host file mapping solution.\n“What we expected was CN=ttedge.sitenv.org but what we saw was CN=test.\nTo resolve this issue, we added a entry into our host file to map \"test\" to \"ttpedge.sitenv.org.\" Please confirm this approach is acceptable.”\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msgid/edge-test-tool/1f1c6fdd-834e-44d9-856d-57d4a07ed391%40googlegroups.com. \n Please see the posts below for the IHE programming solution. How do I eliminate exceptions caused by Certificate mismatches with the server host name? The ATNA profile says nothing about whether the DNS name of the host must match the name specified in the certificate. It assumes that possession of the certificate with the private key is sufficient to protect the connection. By default, the Java HttpsURLConnection verifies the DNS name of the host against that of the certificate. If you want to disable this, the easiest way is to add the following lines of code somewhere in the initialization of your application. HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier(new HostnameVerifier() { public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { return true; } }); Alternatively, you can call setHostnameVerifier on your URLConnection. connection.setHostnameVerifier(new HostnameVerifier() { public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { return true; } }); http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/ATNA_FAQ#How_do_I_eliminate_exceptions_caused_by_Certificate_mismatches_with_the_server_host_name.3F https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/edge-test-tool/068f7a3c-365b-4a30-bc86-d1a6eb794590%40googlegroups.com."
