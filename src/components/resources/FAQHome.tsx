                    <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ mb: 1.5 }}>
                      A: 1. Using the C-CDA Validator 2.1, Step 1 is to select whether you are performing a Sender
                      specific test or Receiver Specific test (Select Sender / Receiver). a. The above choice will make
                      what appears when you click the “Select Document “ to change based on the SUT role. b. In your
                      case you would select “Sender”

                    <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ mb: 1 }}>
                      1. Then you would select the criteria first and for each criteria that you select you may have one
                      or more PDF files.

                    <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ mb: 1 }}>
                      5. Then in the C-CDA Validator Step 3, you have to select the Criteria and the PDF file which you
                      used to generate the C-CDA.

                      The above sequence is what you would use to validate the C-CDA files you generated using the test

                      If you want to validate files generated by your system without using the test data provided then
                      you can proceed to Step 3 and select “CCDAIGOnly” or “CCDAIGPlus_Vocab” options and then upload
                      and validate. This is to help vendors prepare their systems however certification procedures
                      require the use of the provided test data unless you work with the ATLs to file for deviations to
                      the test data.

NDC is published as a standard for immunizations as a CCDS element and the ONC\'s CCDS companion guide cites that it\'s supported as a translational element accompanying the CVX code in CDA R2.1. Looking at the 2.1 IG, NDC is referenced within the Immunization Medication Information entry-level template with the Vaccine Clinical Drug value set stating: "Value set intensionally defined from RXNORM (OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.88), comprised of those codes whose ingredients map to NDC codes that the CDC associates with CVX codes."
